# HotPlate

Hot plate project's purpose is to control the temperature of a hot plate that is used for reflow soldering of PCBs in small numbers. The application
will support a camera for more analysis and study of the process of soldering. The application accepts Gerber, Pick&Place, and BOM, so then the 
user will have a full assembly guideline and also with the connected camera it's possible to confirm the quality and validity of placement and assembly.
